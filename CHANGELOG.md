# [Unreleased] 4.12 - in development

This version will be the first to use this changelog file for gathering notes

 # [Unreleased] 4.11 - to be released soon

This release is currently prepared outside of this changelog file

# 4.10 ‚Äì extra command lines, background images, and more

This release has been a long time coming, thanks to the vagaries of obtaining a new code signing certificate for our Windows builds. Consequently there are a lot of changes which made it into Mudlet 4.10. Let‚Äôs go over some of the highlights!

## What is Mudlet?

It‚Äôs a platform with which you can play multiplayer, pure-text RPGs ‚Äì called MUDs, precursors to today‚Äôs MMORPGs. There are thousands of unique worlds online ‚Äì [download](https://www.mudlet.org/download/) Mudlet for free on Windows/macOS/Linux, join one and enjoy!

## Extra command lines

You‚Äôve been asking for it, you waited patiently, now thanks to [Edru](https://github.com/Edru2/) you can have‚Ä¶ multiple command lines! Whenever you want a second one for role-playing, your chat window to have configuration, or anything else, this is now possible:

![](https://wiki.mudlet.org/images/0/0c/AdditionalCommandLine.png)

To turn on a commandline in a miniconsole, [see here](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Geyser#Enable_and_use_your_miniconsole_command_line). To create a stand-alone, free floating command line, [see here](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Geyser#Geyser.CommandLine).

## Background images for miniconsoles

You know what else you‚Äôve been waiting and asking for? Background images on miniconsoles! Edru has been on a roll!

![enter image description here](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Selection_363.png)

This also means that the usual c/d/heho color formatting functions now accept transparency as a parameter. [See here](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Geyser#Change_your_miniconsole_background_image) on how to set a background image.

This also means that you can try setting a background image for the main window as well ‚Äì but you might find that games often hardcode the black background, so it‚Äôs not ideal.

## Math in Geyser

Have you been struggling to get your Geyser elements lined up **just right** and wished you could nudge it over just a few pixels? Been avoiding Geyser and using another option so you could have math in your constraints? Well, now you can use Geyser and receive all of its updates and use math in your constraints.

This means for example if you have a 32√ó32 label you want to center you can do so by using Label1:move(‚Äú50%-16px‚Äú,‚Äú50%+10px‚Äú), or using ‚Äú50%-16px‚Äù for both the x and y when making the label.

**Note:** this improvement will also find your typos! For example if you had ‚Äú95%%‚Äù before, that (invalid) constraint won‚Äôt work anymore. Find these bugs easily by searching for %%.

## Other Geyser Improvements

Geyser.Label also allows you to use ‚Äúnocolor‚Äù as the text color, which will then allow for coloring the text via CSS. It also picked up the Geyser.Label:rawEcho(txt) function, which skips over all the formatting assistance normally provided by Geyser.Label:echo().

Geyser.MiniConsole gains Geyser.MiniConsole:display() which works just like regular display(), but outputs in the miniconsole instead of your main display.
Tired of copying things to a miniconsole and not being able to click them? Wish you could keep your MXP links intact in a miniconsole? Well, now you can! Edru once again stepped up to the plate for this one.

## New color functions for feedTriggers

Have you struggled to test your color triggers? Tired of hand-crafting escape sequences when using feedTriggers()? Well, Demonnic was even if you weren‚Äôt, so he added some new functions for working with feedTriggers. decho2ansi() and hecho2ansi() will take any decho or hecho string and return an ansi colored string. The functions are used by the new feedTriggers variants, dfeedTriggers and hfeedTriggers which allow for you to send colored text to the trigger engine for testing your color triggers. Also added is cfeedTriggers, which uses color names but uses a limited color table which corresponds to the ansi standard colors, IE black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, and lightBlack, lightRed, etc. You can also use a number from 0-255 to get the ansi 256 color equivalent.

## Multi-view forever!

Now you can open ALL THE PROFILES! and move between them with your mouse and keyboard shortcuts without it turning multiview off. Have fun multiplaying!

## Telnet CHARSET support

Game admins will be happy about this feature ‚Äì it is now possible to automatically set Mudlet‚Äôs text encoding ‚Äì for example, to be utf8 in case your game supports emojis ‚Äì using the [CHARSET protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2066). Big thanks to Tamarindo from [StickMUD](https://www.stickmud.com/) for pulling that one in.

## Music/sound in MXP

Tamarindo also went ahead and added sound/music support to Mudlet‚Äôs MXP implementation. That said, there‚Äôs a much more modern [Mud Client Media Protocol](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Special:MyLanguage/Standards:MUD_Client_Media_Protocol) that you should aim to use üòâ

## Scrollbar improvements

You‚Äôll not be surprised to hear this one is Edru as well. Had you noticed Mudlet‚Äôs scrollbars behaving a bit‚Ä¶ oddly? Jumping around, not resizing itself, stuff like that? Well, Edru‚Äôs put a lot of work into this and it should all work much more smoothly now.
 

## macOS 10.13 High Sierra

Apple will stop supporting 10.13 High Sierra in November 2020, and Mudlet will have to follow suit. Thus Mudlet 4.10 will be the last version to support 10.13, which had a good run of 3 years!

# 4.9 ‚Äì Public Test Builds & ANSI art

We‚Äôve improved Mudlet‚Äôs editor and highlighting as well as even more improved art display. Also, you can now every day receive new Mudlet developments with our Public Test Build (PTB) version!

## Public Test Builds

While these have been prepared for a few months now, PTB are finally mature enough to be mentioned here. You can now always play with the most recent Mudlet developments enabled, if you don‚Äôt want to wait for the next official release.

New PTB versions are built nightly, hence their icons are dark, whereas new developments start with a dim red sun light. See immediately which is which via distinct icons both before and after you started Mudlet.

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Application-icons.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Application-icons.png)

Mudlet PTB will be installed right next to your regular Mudlet. Meanwhile, the original release version will stay unchanged, so you can always go back. Find the latest PTB on top of Mudlet‚Äôs snapshot website: **[https://make.mudlet.org/snapshots/?platform=all&source=ptb](https://make.mudlet.org/snapshots/?platform=all&source=ptb)**

Please beware: Even though we test new features, the PTB may actually still break sometimes. Please report any doubts or feedback to us, so we can fix things long before the official release happens. This is why we‚Äôre doing this: for better Mudlet quality.

## Improved ANSI art display

While Mudlet 4.8 started CP437 support, we received a [request for help in Mudlet forums](https://forums.mudlet.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=22887). A player wondered why Mudlet would not display their game‚Äôs sweet ANSI art upon connection as expected. SlySven investigated and fixed the issue, even surpassing the original request:

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cp437.gif)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cp437.gif)

Please feel free to let us know any display problems you may find with Mudlet in your games, so we can look into them as well. Or even better, send us a fix to review! ;-)

## Highlight foreground or background only

Even non-tech-savy users can easily use triggers in Mudlet to highlight interesting words or phrases happening in their games. The default highlighting will use red foreground and yellow background color.

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/highlight.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/highlight.png)

With the new Mudlet version, you can now choose to only use one of them for highlighting and keep the other one as-is. In the example, keep the (maybe different) foreground colors, just use yellow background.

## Editor placeholder text

Mudlet‚Äôs feature-rich script-editor (edbee) just learned a new trick: The initial comment ‚Äúput your Lua code here‚Äù will vanish, as soon as you start typing. No more left over fragments at the beginning of your code scripts!

[![editor placeholder text](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/placeholder.gif)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/placeholder.gif)

# 4.8 ‚Äì Drag and drop packages, custom cursors, and amazing maps

This is an amazing release that adds drag and drop packages, custom cursors, draggable labels and more! Mudlet is now more powerful than ever for building stunning, modern interfaces for MUDs.

## Drag and drop packages

Thanks to Edru, who massively improved Geyser and Userwindows in the [last update](http://mudlet.org/4-6), you can now drag and drop packages into Mudlet to install them. Pretty simple!

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/drag-and-drop-package-install.gif)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/drag-and-drop-package-install.gif)

Credit: [Eraene‚Äôs DarkTheme](https://forums.mudlet.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=22728)

Along with this comes a [sysDropEvent](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Event_Engine#sysDropEvent), so you can code a custom action when a file is dropped into Mudlet. If you‚Äôre a package author, remember you can make use of the [sysInstall](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Event_Engine#sysInstall) event to notify that your package has been installed. Enjoy!

## Carrion Fields added

[This game](http://www.carrionfields.net/) has put together a seriously impressive Mudlet package and we‚Äôre honoured to have them added to Mudlet officially! Double-click on CF in the Connection screen to play :)

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_591-1024x572.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_591.png)

Carrion Fields is a unique blend of high-caliber roleplay and complex, hardcore player-versus-player combat that has been running continuously, and 100% free, for over 25 years.

Choose from among 21 races, 17 highly customizable classes, and several cabals and religions to suit your playstyle and the story you want to tell. Our massive, original world is full of secrets and envied limited objects that take skill to acquire and great care to keep.

We like to think of ourselves as the Dark Souls of MUDs, with a community that is supportive of new players ‚Äì unforgiving though our world may be. Join us for a real challenge and real rewards: adrenalin-pumping battles, memorable quests run by our volunteer immortal staff, and stories that will stick with you for a lifetime.

## Adjustable Containers

Edru didn‚Äôt just stop with drag and drop ‚Äì [adjustable containers](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Geyser#Adjustable.Container) are in as well! What does it mean? It means labels/miniconsoles that you can move around and reposition just by dragging! No code needed.

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/adjustable-container.gif)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/adjustable-container.gif)

Try this code in Mudlet:

testCon = testCon or Adjustable.Container:new({name="testContainer"})  
testLabel = Geyser.Label:new({x=0, y=0, height="100%", width="100%", color="green"},testCon)

## Search within the script

Dicene also added a cool feature ‚Äì you can now hit **Ctrl+F** to search within the script only, not your entire Mudlet profile!

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_583.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_583.png)

He didn‚Äôt just stop there either ‚Äì you can now toggle whenever you‚Äôd like to search within variables, default off so it‚Äôs quicker:

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Workspace-1_585.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Workspace-1_585.png)

## CP437 encoding now supported

Thanks to SlySven, the CP437 encoding is now supported. Along with a custom font, [Medievia](http://www.medievia.com/) makes use of this to draw amazing custom maps :)

[![CP437 encoding with a custom font](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62970949/80146038-2a957480-857f-11ea-860e-e127feeec9c1.JPG)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62970949/80146038-2a957480-857f-11ea-860e-e127feeec9c1.JPG)

Check out a [few more](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62970949/80146037-29fcde00-857f-11ea-9ae0-40f316bc5687.JPG) [screenshots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62970949/80146039-2b2e0b00-857f-11ea-9f13-03c0ea082276.JPG).

## Custom cursors

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/custom-cursors-demo.gif)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/custom-cursors-demo.gif)

Yep, custom cursors are here! Curious? Download, drag, and drop [this demo package](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/File:Cursor_grid.zip) into Mudlet to try all the cursors out :)

Big thanks to Edru for adding these in.

## New API features

gcms added MXP as another format that you can get data / events from, just like GMCP. [Check it out](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Supported_Protocols#MXP)!

demonnic did a pass over the table functions ‚Äì [table.contains()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Table_Functions#table.contains) can now check within multiple nested tables, and [table.collect()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Table_Functions#table.collect), [table.n_collect()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Table_Functions#table.n_collect), [table.matches()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Table_Functions#table.matches), [table.n_matches()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Table_Functions#table.n_matches) to make working with tables easier.

Thanks to Edru, you can now manipulate the syncing of a module with [enableModuleSync()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Miscellaneous_Functions#enableModuleSync), [disableModuleSync()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#disableModuleSync), and [getModuleSync()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#getModuleSync), and add/edit the Scripts as you see them in Mudlet with [enableScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#enableScript), [disableScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#disableScript), [setScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#setScript), [getScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#getScript), [permScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#permScript), and [appendScript()](https://wiki.mudlet.org/w/Manual:Lua_Functions#appendScript).

Edru also improved on the userwindows ‚Äì you can now choose whenever they should be popped out or docked at start, and if docked, which area should they be in. Autodocking while dragging can now be disabled, too!

A few more improvements are also present ‚Äì see the full changelog below.

## Geyser:show() fixed

As mentioned [two months ago](https://www.mudlet.org/2020/03/4-6-geyser-geyser-geyser/), we‚Äôve fixed an issue where you could still :show() the child of a hidden container. If your UI relied on this broken behaviour, make sure to update it!

## Script editor sizes

Alias/trigger/script editors are no longer huge by default, and they‚Äôll remember their sizes as well. Thanks to dicene for covering this off!

## Polish translation ![‚≠ê](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/2b50.svg =250px)

Big thanks to mwarzec for translating the entirety of Mudlet into Polish! In his own words, it was possible thanks to:

home.. sweet home.. and no reasons to go outside..

[![](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_589-1024x329.png)](https://www.mudlet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Selection_589.png)

## Did I miss 4.7?

We skipped 4.7 because that was the [April Fools](https://mudlet.org/4-7) version ;)

-   Mudlet‚Äôs language is auto-detected and set for new players automatically
